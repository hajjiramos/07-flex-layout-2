# 07-flex-layout-2

Recreate an incredibly common website layout.

It is often called the Holy Grail layout.

Hints:
You will need to change the flex-direction to push the footer down.
You will need to add some divs as containers to get things to line up correctly.
flex-wrap will help get the cards aligned correctly.
Make sure you define how much space the cards should take up, in order for flex-wrap to work as intended.
